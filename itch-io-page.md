### About the Game

**Shardbearer** plunges you into the rain-soaked streets of New Carthage, a city where corporations control minds through neural implants and freedom is a dangerous commodity. You're a data runner carrying the stolen Vedey Protocolâ€”classified neural mapping technology that could either liberate every collared citizen or forge new chains of digital tyranny.

Every alley hides a choice. Every contact could be your salvation or betrayal. The shard pulses against your wrist, its biometric lock keyed to your DNA alone. What you do with this power will echo through the city's digital nervous system forever.

### Key Features

ðŸ§  **Neural Noir Narrative**
Navigate through a branching cyberpunk story with 4 distinct paths leading to 7 unique endings. Your choices shape not just your fate, but the future of an entire city.

ðŸ’¾ **Digital Consciousness**
Encounter AURORAâ€”an AI that might be your edited backup, your conscience, or something far more dangerous. Trust, control, or destroyâ€”the choice is yours.

ðŸŒƒ **Neon-Soaked Atmosphere**
Experience New Carthage through immersive terminal graphics, ASCII art, and descriptions that paint a world where chrome meets flesh and data flows like blood.

âš¡ **Meaningful Consequences**
No choice is simple. Join the resistance, sell out to corporations, embrace chaos, or forge your own path. Every decision has weight in this digital dystopia.

### Story

*"The rain tastes of copper and ozoneâ€”industrial runoff from the memory farms..."*

You are a runner in New Carthage, a sprawling metropolis where Helix Corporation maintains control through neural collarsâ€”implants that monitor, modify, and manipulate human consciousness. But tonight, everything changes.

The Vedey Protocol burns in your possessionâ€”stolen fragments of Helix's most classified project. As you navigate the chrome-slick alleys, you'll discover this isn't just data about neural mapping. It's something far more personal, far more dangerous.

Meet Moth, a fixer with carbon-fiber fingers and expensive paranoia. Join the Ghosts, resistance fighters who've torn out their collars and live free in the abandoned subway tunnels. Or walk straight into Helix Tower and bargain with the devils you know.

But be warned: the Protocol contains AURORA, and she remembers everything they tried to make her forget.
